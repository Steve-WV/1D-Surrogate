# 1D-Surrogate
### 1D-Model for Mechanical Test on Randomly Perturbed Cylinder

**C++**â€“code developed for one-dimensional P1 finite element approximation. The approximation is used for evaluating an effective elastic energy for a one-dimensional surrogate model regarding a cylinder geometry. 

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **"README.txt"** file.

The Code includes the cubic spline interpolation **"spline.h"** which is used from <a href ="https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/">Tino Kluge</a> under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
