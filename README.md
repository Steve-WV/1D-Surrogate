# 1D-Surrogate
1D-Model for Mechanical Test on Randomly Perturbed Cylinder

**C++**â€“code developed for one-dimensional P1 finite element approximation. The approximation is used for evaluating an effective elastic energy for a one-dimensional surrogate model regarding a cylinder geometry. 

The Code uses the open source software package on cubic spline interpolation in <b> C++ </b> from <a href ="https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/">here</a>

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **Readme.txt** file.
